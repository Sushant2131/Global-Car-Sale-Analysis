# Global-Car-Sale-Analysis
Global Car Sales Analysis

This repository explores trends and insights in global car sales data. The project aims to uncover patterns, identify factors influencing sales, and potentially predict future trends.

Key Features:

Data Analysis: Leverages Python libraries like pandas and potentially others (seaborn, matplotlib) to clean, manipulate, and analyze car sales data.
Visualization: Creates informative visualizations (charts, graphs) to effectively communicate insights from the data.
Exploration (Optional): May include interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for deeper exploration.
